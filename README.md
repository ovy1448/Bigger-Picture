* **About:**
  - This is my first project ever made. It was simple work with external *API* from Unsplash using vanilla *Javascript* and *XHR* method.       Working with *JSON* data type and sorting its content into grid like layout using CSS *columns* and making everything responsive with *@media* queries.
* **Things i would do differently now:**
  - I would use *Fetch* or *Axio*s instead of *XHR* for *HTTP requests*.
  - For the image layout use newer *Flexbox* instead of *columns*.
  - Writing better function for next/previous page.
  - Expanding more by adding new functions thanks to the *API* opportunities.

I do intend to come back to this and redo and work on this more, there is a lot i can practice and learn on this project.
